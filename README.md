# CapacitanceCalc
A serial and parallel code written in fortran90 (using openMPI and DISLIN) to solve the Laplace equation using the Jacobi iteration in the context of capacitance and the distribution of electric fields. 

Inluded are a couple of animations/ simulations caused by varying the plates location and size plotted with DISLIN.
